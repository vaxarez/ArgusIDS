# Argus-IDS

**Argus-IDS** is a lightweight Intrusion Detection System (IDS) written in C, combining both signature-based and anomaly-based detection.  
The name refers to Argus Panoptes, a mythical giant with one hundred eyes who never slept — the perfect metaphor for a vigilant network guardian.

---

## 🔐 Description

> This project was created as a graduation project to demonstrate core IDS concepts using the C programming language.  
> It features packet sniffing, detection by known attack signatures, and simple anomaly heuristics.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- 📡 Captures live network traffic using `libpcap`
- 🧾 Signature-based detection from a local database (`signatures.db`)
- 🔍 Basic anomaly detection (suspicious sizes, uncommon protocols, etc.)
- ⚠️ Responds to detections with logging and console alerts
- ⚙️ Configurable via `config.ini`
